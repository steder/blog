I love yogurt.  In an effort to prove my devotion to the creamy and tangy Greek yogurt that I adore I've started to make my own.<br /><br />Aside from some time and attention, yogurt is not that difficult to make and the homemade stuff is quite delicious and the leftover whey is very useful in bread making as I'll try to show later on.<br /><br />First here's what you need:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Thanks for the tips, KoI.  I really like the idea of not using such high heat and since I really prefer strained yogurt I&#39;ll have to give straining without cooling a try.<br /><br />I find it really quite cool how many different techniques people can use to produce yogurt.  I appreciate your ideas because I am hoping to find a recipe that is minimal effort and produces awesome yogurt.</div>

I don&#39;t have a thermometer so I inoculate at the maximum temperature I can indefinitely immerse my finger in the milk.<br /><br />I started out heating the milk to high temperatures and then trying to cool it down with ice before it started scorching.<br />I found you can skip this step.<br /><br />The milk bacteria seem to work just fine with the yogurt culture.  Furthermore, milk loses most of its flavor when it&#39;s heated to high temperature.  I think a lot more stuff than just the bacteria gets broken down.<br />Works well to heat the milk up very gently and only to inoculation temperature. <br />This can take an hour or longer with a two gallon batch, but I just do other things while checking back on it periodically.<br /><br />Since even whole milk is a bit lacking in character, I find yogurt also benefits from some heavy cream.  About a half pint to a pint per gallon makes it extra rich.<br /><br />I find a grainy texture usually results only when the yogurt is strained a bit prematurely, before curd and whey have completely separated.  I find it comes out a bit grainy like a farmers cheese at less than 7 hours.  I&#39;ve fermented for as long as 24 hours and still gotten decent batches.  Best to err on the side of tartness.<br /><br />No need to cool the yogurt before straining.  Just as well to let it continue developing even in your strainer.  Not to mention it will strain faster when warm.<br /><br />The yogurt doesn&#39;t go completely dormant when refrigerated.  The bacteria still slowly does its work.  Probably best to wait until serving before adding sweeteners.  Easily digestible, naked sugars make it easy for new organisms to move in or ones already there to proliferate out of control.</div>
