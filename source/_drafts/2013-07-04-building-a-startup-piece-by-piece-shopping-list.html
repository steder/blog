If I were building a startup today here's just a braindump of software, hardware, and services I'd pick up to build it.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Software</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>This is a long list so I'm just going to try to give a little detail about why each thing is useful. &nbsp;There is no particular order to this list just yet as I'm just trying to organize my thoughts.<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Python (PyPy, CPython, IronPython): &nbsp;There are other programming languages that are effective but for me nothing really competes with Python. &nbsp;I think in Web Applications the Python ecosystem is really healthy. &nbsp;Of course there are some other interesting open source choices like Ruby, Go, Racket (CLisp, Scheme), Node.js, OCaml, Lua, Scala, Haskell, Erlang, IO, Smalltalk (Seaside), etc. &nbsp;And then we can start to talk about the less interesting but perfectly viable choices like C, C++, and Java. &nbsp;However, I think in a startup environment you want to move quickly and that means that all other things being equal use the tool you know best. &nbsp;You may disagree that all other things are equal when compared to the plethora of other languages out there but I think that in terms of the ability to quickly prototype and deploy a web application with reasonable performance characteristics it's hard to beat Python.</li><li>Emacs: &nbsp;You need development tools. &nbsp;I prefer Emacs for essentially everything. &nbsp;Others might recommend Vim, PyCharm, TextMate, etc. &nbsp;Personally I find that again, the best tool for the job is the one you're most familiar with.</li><li>CI Server (Hudson / Jenkins): &nbsp;I think that it's hard to exaggerate the importance of a continuous integration machine in your workflow. &nbsp;Even with a single developer the exercise of setting up a build server and automating your test runs removes a class of "works for me" type errors as well as increasing visibility into test failures which is critical when using automated testing to improve the quality of your product. &nbsp;CI servers can also be used to help automate deployment to various environments and otherwise make your life easier.</li><li>Distributed Version Control System: While Subversion is still the 800 lb gorilla of VCS systems it's hard to ignore the usefulness of distributed VCS. &nbsp;I think local access to the entire version control history, performance, better merging, and excellent free hosting services really make DVCSs a better choice than SVN. &nbsp;I've vacillated between Mercurial and Git over the last several years, and I've even dabbled slightly with Bazaar. &nbsp;Personally I think you can't go too wrong with any of them but at the moment I'm thinking Git.. &nbsp;Git's downside, the awkward and counterintuitive terminology, is largely outweighed by it's speed and flexibility. &nbsp;Personally I find git's builtin rebase a better fit for my mental model of branching (where branches are always relative of the current trunk) where mercurial is more about perserving history and so the collapsing of history done by a rebase is not recommended. &nbsp;Honestly, like Emacs or Python, I think it boils down to which one you know best.</li><li>TDD: &nbsp;PyUnit, JSUnit are incredibly helpful in building always working code. &nbsp;If you really follow the test driven mantra there is a test case for every line of code in your system. &nbsp;While concurrency or unexpected user input (among other things) can introduce new bugs it's a way of writing self documenting code and ensuring that bugs once fixed stay fixed. &nbsp;It also can help improve the design and quality of code by forcing you to make the code flexible enough to be easily tested and it makes it easier to test and validate a large number of potential inputs without requiring manual testing. &nbsp;Manual testing can crush you if you let it.</li><li>Functional Test Suite: &nbsp;Selenium. &nbsp;In addition to testing the logic you probably want to test that your pages look how you think that should look and that the javascript that you wrote can actually work with the DOM on your pages in various browsers. &nbsp;Integrate this into your CI process.</li><li>Performance Testing: &nbsp;Blitz.io, JMeter/Grinder, httperf, etc. &nbsp;You should having tooling that you can integrate into your CI process that tests the performance of your system and reports changes from build to build. &nbsp;Ideally every release will be at least as fast as the last release if not faster. &nbsp;Having some kind of test process that identifies how many requests per second you can handle and simulates things like performance under burst-ier loads, etc is really important.</li><li>Monitoring (?nagios, cacti, zenoss?): I think it is critical to have visibility into what your servers are doing at any given moment. &nbsp;Furthermore I think this information should be available to the whole team. &nbsp;This should include low level information about CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, etc.</li><li>Logging (?syslog, loggly?): Centralized logging across all machines can help with debugging, security auditing, performance testing, etc. &nbsp;Obviously this needs to be balanced with performance concerns (you don't want logging to slow you down) and some conventions on the types of things that should be logged.</li><li>Load Balancing (?)</li><li>Static File Server (?apache, cherokee, nginx?)</li><li>Application Server (?twisted, django, gevent, pyramid?)</li><li>Caching Layer(s) (?memcache, redis?)</li><li>Database(es) (?couchdb, mongodb, cassandra, postgresql?)</li><li>Administrative Dashboards and/or Control Panels (?): Non-technical users within your organization are going to want to see what's going on in your system. &nbsp;Optionally you may provide them access to the monitoring / logging systems but it may make more sense to build a custom application that these trusted non-programmers can use to see status of users and perform common troubleshooting or customer support tasks (e.g.: things like resetting user passwords, (un)banning users, moderating users, checking status of user jobs, etc).&nbsp;</li><li>OpenSource: &nbsp;I think that the best organizations are both consumers and producers of open source software. &nbsp;On principle I prefer GPL but I find that in practice many people are more comfortable with the Apache/BSD/MIT style licenses that do not require distribution of your changes. &nbsp;I feel like from a producers perspective the GPL is clearly better because you push people to contribute back. &nbsp;From the consumers perspective a more permissive license is better because you can hang onto any code you feel gives you an advantage over your competition. &nbsp;However, I feel that the GPL is probably superior in either case. &nbsp;If you and your competition both use Linux, and both customize Linux, you both benefit from the others work. &nbsp;Furthermore, on the Web people are competing more for users than for functionality. &nbsp;For example, look at Bitbucket and Github. &nbsp;At this point they both have a bunch of overlap, and even though BB has free private repos and support for both git and hg it has a smaller userbase. &nbsp;Social pressure keeps people using github. &nbsp;Github's reputation, and not its feature set, is what gives it the edge. &nbsp;I think that unless you're in the rare position of cornering the market on a particular user base or niche that software is not what is going to make or break you but rather your agility, attitude, custom service, responsiveness, etc. &nbsp;Basically users aren't 100% rational and they aren't driven by features or price as much as brands, social pressures, and other niceties like unobtrusive ads, page design, etc. &nbsp;Another example is AWS and Rackspace. &nbsp;Both are successful infrastructure as a service providers. &nbsp;Both have opensource stacks that can be used to run your own infrastructure as a service (Eucalyptus and OpenStack respectively). &nbsp;However, the real value of Rackspace or AWS is not the software (which again, is open source and available online for anyone to use or extend) but the service provided by both companies. &nbsp;Basically I believe that by the very nature of software that the value isn't the code but the expertise necessary to write that code to begin with and that by jealously hiding your source from the competition you're admitting that you can't compete on what really matters. &nbsp;<strike>Remember, the internet is a huge place. &nbsp;Anyone entering the web should understand that the difficult part is not coding up some models and views and reading and writing data from a database but rather providing a service to users better than anyone else on the internet. &nbsp;Any competitor has to convince users to jump ship and they have to do that through pricing, better service, or more features. &nbsp;If they base their work on your GPL'd source code you get those better features too which forces them to compete on tougher things like service and pricing.</strike></li></ul><div><span style="font-size: large;">Hardware</span></div><div><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div>It's really tempting to just say use Amazon. &nbsp;Of course, Amazon has had network hiccups before and Amazon is relatively expensive if you have a very stable userbase. &nbsp;However, for the initial period of growth I think Amazon is hard to beat due to its elasticity. &nbsp;I think your best bet is to use Rackspace Cloud + Amazon Web Services together so that you can have some failover and "offsite" backups and monitoring in the event of an outage on either service. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Alternatively, if you're reasonably well funded and have room for a moderately sized server room it may be worthwhile to buy your own hardware and a few T1's worth of internet access.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Cloud Pros</div><div><ul><li>Elastic: You can add new machines easily</li><li>Flexible: &nbsp;You can change those machines easily</li><li>No big capital investment upfront. &nbsp;</li><li>Ala carte pricing, billed only for what you use.</li><li>DevOps. &nbsp;Your developers can script and automate operations tasks.</li><li>Automate provisioning</li></ul><div>Cloud Cons</div></div><div><ul><li>Higher hourly costs without committing and paying for reservations in 1yr/3yr terms.</li><li>Higher storage cost per gigabyte</li><li>Requires more expertise to automate and administrate</li><li>DevOps: Developers need to think about redundancy.</li><li>DevOps: Developers need to think about deployment.</li><li>DevOps: Developers need to think about scaling services on demand.</li><li>Maintenance windows for old AMI's, kernel patches, etc. &nbsp;</li><li>Still have to sometimes deal with instance failures.</li></ul><div>DIY Pros</div><div><ul><li>Hardware can be very cheap and you end up paying less per hour to run it</li><li>No virtualization so you have better control and potentially get better resource allocation</li></ul><div>DIY Cons</div></div><div><ul><li>Hardware failures still happen so you need to buy extra machines and spare parts, maintenance, etc.</li><li>Maintenance workers can cut the cable and your business is completely offline. &nbsp;</li><li>Elasticity and flexibility are expensive because you have to buy new hardware (and perhaps new support contracts, etc). &nbsp;It's all or nothing. &nbsp;If you need double capacity for a 1 week marketing blitz you have to buy that hardware even though it's going to sit idle if that blitz doesn't go well.</li><li>In house IT because more important</li><ul><li>internal networking infrastructure becomes important</li><ul><li>routing between internal and external networks and traffic</li><li>dns, dhcp</li></ul><li>maintenance of machines, patching kernels, etc</li></ul></ul></div><div>Basically, I think the cloud is great from a flexibility and elasticity perspective. &nbsp;I also think that being able to program your deployment (request instance from cloud provider, install packages, start service, etc) is really awesome. &nbsp;On the downside, I think the you can end up paying more in the short term for that flexibility and I think that your developers also need to join the ranks of DevOps. &nbsp;I think that DevOps underestimates the amount of work required for developers to own the whole toolchain and underestimates the value of a good system administrator. &nbsp;Perhaps another pro and con chart is needed.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, many of the downsides of DIY is buying your own hardware and honestly any organization of a non-trivial size ends up with some IT staff to support users. &nbsp;For example, if you have sales or support people you'll likely need some IT people to back them up. &nbsp;You can either have your developers take on this job as well or you can hire someone just to handle this internal support role. &nbsp;The real question is more whether or not developers are supported by internal IT or whether developers really become devops and take on the role of building, deploying and supporting the production systems as well as developing those systems.</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">DevOps</span></div><div><br /></div><div>DevOps Pros</div><div><ul><li>Developers have more control.</li><li>Developers understand the whole system, from their application to the tuning parameters for the OS and filesystem to the Database tuning params and configuration.</li><li>Developers can automate more as you can automate the provisioning of machines as well as deployment.</li><li>Continuous Deployment?</li></ul><div>DevOps Cons</div></div><div><ul><li>Developers are responsible for the whole system and can make more costly mistakes</li><li>You can spend a considerable amount of time and energy on deployment, infrastructure, tools, researching OSes, filesystems, databases, performance tuning of VMs, AWS EBS, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Contributes to developer stress and burnout</li><li>Requires developers to be on-call</li></ul><div>I think most of my concerns about DevOps revolve around the people developing the application and the people deploying and maintaining the infrastructure being the same people. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In my opinion if you hire N developers to build your app and M developers to maintain the infrastructure you'd end up with N+M happier developers and a better system than if you try to get those N+M developers to share responsibility for those two aspects of the system. &nbsp;Further, I think what typically happens is a company hires just N developers and expects them to handle both jobs. &nbsp;Ultimately I think that while making your developers do double duty is possible, it is not wise. &nbsp;Operating your service 365/7/24 is a full time job so you either short change development or operations or both. &nbsp;DevOps has a real cost. &nbsp;It may be the right choice for your company but you shouldn't consider it a cost cutting measure but rather as one or more of the following tradeoffs:</div></div><div><ul><li>Features for customers vs. Infrastructure improvements: &nbsp;Does your team spend time adding new features for your users or do they improve the automated backups and log rotation in production?</li><li>Specialization vs. generalization: &nbsp;Do you hire experts in a particular area (Python, SQL, JS) or generalists who can work on anything? &nbsp;</li><li>Event Driven vs. Task Driven: &nbsp;Do you want developers constantly context switching as issues occur (a cert is about to expire, a machine is low on disk space, a node failed and needs to be replaced) or do you want developers pulling a task from the bug tracker, fixing said bug, and moving on to the next bug? &nbsp;Operations/Systems work can be very event driven. &nbsp;Sure, you plan deployments and big infrastructure changes but you're also constantly responding to things going on in your system which has a lot of context switching overhead for developers. &nbsp;Development is typically more Task Driven. &nbsp;For example: &nbsp;Improve Performance for Feature X by Y%, Allow users to customize their login page, refactor database schema for storing customer budgets, add versioning for widgets, etc. &nbsp;Typically you'll want your devs to focus on these problems until they're fixed. &nbsp;Some problems really only get fixed with focused attention for days (or weeks) at a time. &nbsp;Constant interruptions to support users, machines, or other developers isn't going to get that work done efficiently.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br
