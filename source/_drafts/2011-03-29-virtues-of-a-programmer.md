Someone asked me a question relating to Larry
Wall's [Virtues\_of\_a\_programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall#Virtues_of_a_programmer) today.
 Outside of the frustration with myself for answering that question in a
clumsy and potentially offensive way I feel that it's worth talking
about these virtues for a moment.\
\
The "virtues" are:\

-   Laziness
-   Impatience
-   Hubris

My issue is primarily that all of these words have negative
connotations.  However, if you dig in a bit more and actually read the
descriptions associated with these virtues you can see what Wall is
really describing here and that while the words are unfortunate they
actually are fitting.\
\
For example:  Laziness corresponds to "the quality that makes you expend
a great deal of effort to reduce overall energy expenditure".  So while
I find that laziness is an unfortunate word, it does capture a big part
of why a programmer tries to automate processes and tasks whenever
possible.  However, I think that perhaps the real virtue here is
"Ingenuity" or "Industriousness".\
\
Impatience ("anger at the machine being lazy") refers not to
restlessness or a lack of patience but to
 "intolerance of anything that thwarts, delays, or hinders".\
\
Finally, Hubris
