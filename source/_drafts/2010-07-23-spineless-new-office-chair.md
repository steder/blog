My new job involves working from home so part of what I've been doing
over the last couple weeks has been doing a little work to setup a home
office.  Part of that work has been finding a new office chair,
something to replace my current crappy little chair.\
\
I wasn't too familiar with high end task chairs but I'd heard of the
legendary [Aeron](http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs).
 So I did a little research and hunted around and came up with a short
list of the following chairs to try out (in no particular order):\
\

-   Embody
-   Aeron
-   Zody
-   Leap
-   Freedom
-   Mirra

After some ringing of hands I decided to purchase the most expensive of
the lot, the striking Embody, Herman Miller's followup to the Aeron,
arguably the most iconic ergonomic chair every made.

\

After a brief session with the chair in the store I felt that it was
quite comfortable and adjustable.  The concept and style of the chair
were awesome and unlike anything else.

  Oo, spiny!\

So yes, this chair looks fantastic, has an extremely sophisticated
design, and is supposedly "health positive", meaning sitting in this
chair is actually\
supposed to be good for your back and stress level and so on.\
\
I'd read quite a few glowing reviews of the chair but within hours of
bringing the Embody home I was wondering what I was doing wrong.  I felt
sore and could not get comfortable in the chair regardless of how I
configured it.\
\
After discussing the chair with a few people and reading yet more
positive reviews and experiences online I decided to give the Embody
another couple days to see if I would get used to the odd way in which
the chair was supporting me.\
\
Honestly, I'm still not sure exactly what the problem was, whether I had
never gotten the chair configured or if I am simply too large of a guy
for this chair.  Regardless, I returned the chair after a few days.\
\
Still hoping to get a new office chair, I went back and forth between
the Aeron and the Steelcase Leap.  The "betrayal" of the Embody chair
still fresh in my mind, I was afraid that the Aeron would also be a
disappointment.  While the Leap chair has a few newer features it really
just could not compete with the aeron for comfort.  And while it is
probably not the best feature for how my office is configured at the
moment, I really like the Aeron's forward tilt option. \

  Spineless!  Yet more comfortable then the Embody!

\
The one downside of the Aeron is the rather hard edges around the seat
pan and back rest.  Because of this getting the correct size and
configuration of the chair is essentially so that you don't have any
hard edges digging into your legs or hips.\
\
What does it say about me that I prefer the spineless chair? :-)
