My new job involves working from home so part of what I've been doing over the last couple weeks has been doing a little work to setup a home office. &nbsp;Part of that work has been finding a new office chair, something to replace my current crappy little chair.<br /><br />I wasn't too familiar with high end task chairs but I'd heard of the legendary&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron</a>. &nbsp;So I did a little research and hunted around and came up with a short list of the following chairs to try out (in no particular order):<br /><br /><ul><li>Embody</li><li>Aeron</li><li>Zody</li><li>Leap</li><li>Freedom</li><li>Mirra</li></ul><div>After some ringing of hands I decided to purchase the most expensive of the lot, the striking Embody, Herman Miller's followup to the Aeron, arguably the most iconic ergonomic chair every made.</div><div><br /></div><div>After a brief session with the chair in the store I felt that it was quite comfortable and adjustable. &nbsp;The concept and style of the chair were awesome and unlike anything else. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5HOAXNGNmPE/TE4aDCsagSI/AAAAAAAAAIg/SnMlsCOMYlY/s1600/LI_EMB_P_20080929_021_D.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5HOAXNGNmPE/TE4aDCsagSI/AAAAAAAAAIg/SnMlsCOMYlY/s400/LI_EMB_P_20080929_021_D.jpg" width="313" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oo, spiny!<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px;"><br /></span></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>So yes, this chair looks fantastic, has an extremely sophisticated design, and is supposedly "health positive", meaning sitting in this chair is actually<br />supposed to be good for your back and stress level and so on.<br /><br />I'd read quite a few glowing reviews of the chair but within hours of bringing the Embody home I was wondering what I was doing wrong. &nbsp;I felt sore and could not get comfortable in the chair regardless of how I configured it.<br /><br />After discussing the chair with a few people and reading yet more positive reviews and experiences online I decided to give the Embody another couple days to see if I would get used to the odd way in which the chair was supporting me.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm still not sure exactly what the problem was, whether I had never gotten the chair configured or if I am simply too large of a guy for this chair. &nbsp;Regardless, I returned the chair after a few days.<br /><br />Still hoping to get a new office chair, I went back and forth between the Aeron and the Steelcase Leap. &nbsp;The "betrayal" of the Embody chair still fresh in my mind, I was afraid that the Aeron would also be a disappointment. &nbsp;While the Leap chair has a few newer features it really just could not compete with the aeron for comfort. &nbsp;And while it is probably not the best feature for how my office is configured at the moment, I really like the Aeron's forward tilt option. <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5HOAXNGNmPE/TE4c9WjMSII/AAAAAAAAAIo/aV5hDhRmCNM/s1600/DE_AER_P_20001221_540_D.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5HOAXNGNmPE/TE4c9WjMSII/AAAAAAAAAIo/aV5hDhRmCNM/s320/DE_AER_P_20001221_540_D.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Spineless! &nbsp;Yet more comfortable then the Embody!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />The one downside of the Aeron is the rather hard edges around the seat pan and back rest. &nbsp;Because of this getting the correct size and configuration of the chair is essentially so that you don't have any hard edges digging into your legs or hips.<br /><br />What does it say about me that I prefer the spineless chair? :-)</div>
