<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Previously I'd spent a little time talking about the sentient mess represented by an Emacs users configuration file(s). &nbsp;</span><br /><br />I'm looking to spend a little time each week cleaning up my Emacs configuration and describing both why I use the features I do and how others can tweak emacs to be more productive and to just generally have more fun programming.<br /><br />So without futher ado,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit;">here's something that I use every day:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: large;">Flymake Mode</span><br />One of my favorite features of Emacs, especially for Python code is Flymake. I use flymake-mode to run a syntax checker (my favorite is pyflakes but you could easily use pylint, pychecker, etc) and so flymake-cursor.el and mspython.el include a bunch of customizations that take advantage of flymake.<br />Basically if working correctly (pyflakes is installed and in&nbsp;your path) whenever you edit a python file any lines that are&nbsp;highlighted have either a syntax error, an undefined variable, unused&nbsp;variable, unused import, etc. With flymake-cursor if you move point&nbsp;over those highlighted lines it should show you what the error is in&nbsp;your modeline. Alternatively you can do "CTRL-C CTRL-W" to run&nbsp;pyflakes over the module and show the results in a separate&nbsp;buffer/tab. After doing that I'd hit ALT+` (keybindings.el binds this to 'next-error, it would normally be bound to a function I never use) to cycle through the<br />errors pyflakes points out and have it jump you to the line(s) with&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Obviously, you could do the same thing with javascript,&nbsp;groovy, C, java, etc. Basically you just need a compiler or a lint&nbsp;like program and a quick flymake mode hook in your config. It's really great&nbsp;especially in something like Python. It catches a lot of simple but&nbsp;common errors immediately after you&nbsp;finish typing.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div></div>
