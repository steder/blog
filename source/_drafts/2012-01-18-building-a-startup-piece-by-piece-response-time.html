I'm interested in building software for the internet. &nbsp;Websites and Web applications are exciting to me in the same way chat and networked games are exciting. &nbsp;You have potentially (hopefully!) lots of users and that leads you to work with a few very challenging constraints.<br /><br />For example, a popular website will receive on the order of million of hits a day, every day. &nbsp;Total number of unique users could easily be orders of magnitude lower in the tens of thousands.<br /><br />Now of course when we say "per day" that's really per work day or per some 8 to 12 hour period. &nbsp;Really global / popular websites are always attracting traffic but the average US centric website is going to be busy really for only that core 8-12 hour window. <br /><br />So let's do a little math and get a sense what the technical requirements are to handle millions of hits a day.<br /><br />24 request per second = ceiling(1M hits / (3600 seconds * 12 hours))<br /><br />So assuming our load were evenly distributed across the same 12 hour interval each day we'd need to be able to respond to 24 requests per second for 12 hours straight. <br /><br />Let's dig a little deeper and see what it would take to handle this idealized load:<br /><br />Imagine you have a social networking site where "User 1" says "Gimme page /myfriends" and you:<br /><br /><ul><li>Authentic that the user is "User 1"</li><li>Check that "User 1" has access to the /myfriends page</li><li>Read the list of friends from the database</li><li>Build and return an HTML document including that list of friends</li><li>Increment your internal usage stats, activity metrics, etc.</li></ul><div>Assume the above takes exactly 1 second. &nbsp;The webserver above can handle 10 simultaneous requests with the resources available on the machine and assuming these requests are independent (10 different users, 10 different friends lists, whatever).</div><div><br /></div><div>To handle 24rps we need a total of 3 of these hypothetical webservers and a load balancer to proxy requests to each of these machines. &nbsp;Of course adding the load balancer is going to take some time as well... Imagine that the load balancer adds 0.1 seconds to each request. &nbsp;Of course the good news is we'd have a little bit of headroom here:</div><div><br /></div><div>1.0 = (HITS * RESPONSE_TIME) / (CONCURRENCY * SERVERS)</div><div><br /></div><div>HITS = floor((CONCURRENCY * SERVERS) / RESPONSE_TIME)</div><div><br /></div><div>So our max hits per second are 27 with the above resources allowing us to handle 1.1M requests per "day".</div><div><br /></div><div>Now imagine that we can handle this "Gimme page /myfriends" request in 0.1 seconds and everything else remains the same. &nbsp;</div><div><br />Our response time assuming the load balancer still commits highway robbery and steals 0.1 additional seconds is 0.2 seconds. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We could now handle 150 hits a second or ~6.4M requests per "day" at 100% capacity.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, you probably don't want to be at 100% capacity as your hardware is unlikely to perform its best at that level and you have no headroom for growth, no ability to perform upgrades or update incrementally to a new version, etc.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, I think that 100ms response time is perfectly reasonable goal for a web application of medium to respectably large size. &nbsp;With a load balancer and 2 servers with 100ms response time you can handle over 2M hits a day and be at or below 50% capacity for your service. &nbsp;This gives you time to perform maintenance, upgrades, etc as you can bring 1 server down while still supporting your 1M page hits. It also gives you headroom for traffic spikes, new users, etc as you're not operating at capacity. &nbsp;If nothing else it would give you time to add new servers to your pool as you receive more hits.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
