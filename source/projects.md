# Projects

Some projects I've worked on over the years:

## txTemplate - Interface for template engines in Twisted

Provides simple integration between Twisted's Asynchronous API and the synchronous APIs of many Python template systems so you can use Twiste and Jinja2 (or Genshi or Clearsilver).

## Goose - Migration Tool

A really simple SQL Migration tool.

## Scrabbleator - Word search

I spent some time working up algorithms to find Scrabble words and published a simple web service (Twisted Web with an AJAX UI).

## MaroonMPI - Python Wrapper for MPICH2

A python interface to MySQL I wrote while working at the University of Chicago Climate Systems Group

## Pundler - Stealing ideas from Ruby's Bundler for Python

Managing requirements in Python projects is more complicated than it should be and Pundler is
an attempt to address that.
