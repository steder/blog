A friend of mine once said that he was terrible at Starcraft because his "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbpCLqryN-Q">APM</a>" was too low. &nbsp;APM, if you're not familiar with the acronym stands for &nbsp;"Actions Per Minute" and refers to keypresses or mouse clicks per minute while playing the RTS turned sport, Starcraft. <br /><div><br /></div><div>My friend continued saying that he actually thought his APM while programming was quite high, certainly higher than anything he could manage playing Starcraft. &nbsp;Of course, having nothing better to, I hacked up an Emacs minor mode that would track all your key presses within Emacs and total up an APM score for you.</div><div><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IEqs4i4YinM/T1Y8vMYfv3I/AAAAAAAAKDQ/NoR0VglOlMI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-03-06+at+10.33.51+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="65" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IEqs4i4YinM/T1Y8vMYfv3I/AAAAAAAAKDQ/NoR0VglOlMI/s640/Screen+Shot+2012-03-06+at+10.33.51+AM.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">starcraft.el in 'action'</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, that "sc" in the modeline stands for Starcraft. &nbsp;Install starcraft.el in your emacs configuration and find how hard it is to inflate your actions per minute while writing code in emacs compared to spaming hotkeys in Starcraft 2.<br /><br />Really, I just wanted to do a more substantive bit of Emacs Lisp and this was a fun excuse to do so. <br /><br />You can download and play with the mode <a href="https://gist.github.com/1990900">here</a> on <a href="https://gist.github.com/1990900">Github</a>. <br /><br /></div></div>
