<div class='post'>
I appreciate all the e-mails from folks who've found the Python tutorials useful. &nbsp;I'm finally starting to clean up the site as it's kind of a mess at the moment.<br /><br />There's a long todo list and cleaning up the main page of the site is just the logical place to start.<br /><br />I'll be updating minor problems in the simple HTML tutorials but will I don't plan on making significant changes or additions until I've got a better way to edit and update that content. &nbsp;Most likely this means that I'll be plugging in a real CMS to better manage it. &nbsp;I've some interest in creating a custom engine in Django or Twisted, which might be a really nice example for the tutorials as well as an improvement for me in terms of easy editing and improving the quality of the code running the site currently.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the encouragement to get back to work on the site.<br /><br />I'll keep you posted.</div>
