I figured I'd just post this as a reminder to myself.<br /><br />Today I tried this french press recipe and I thought it turned out pretty well.<br /><br />Ratio of coffee to water: 1/16<br /><br />So that's:<br /><br /><ul><li>64 grams coffee to 32 oz water</li><li>2 oz coffee to 32 oz water</li><li>1/2 oz coffee to 8oz water</li></ul><br />And then it's a very simple procedure:<br /><br /><ol><li>Boil water.</li><li>Grind beans.</li><li>Throw beans in french press</li><li>Steadily pour in hot water (you're looking for a temp between 195F and 205F)</li><li>Allow to steep 3-4 minutes</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

It was quite strong :-)  I think maybe the water was a little too hot and draw out too much of the harsher coffee flavors.  However, since I don&#39;t mind a little extra bitter coffee (I like Starbucks :-P) it was still pretty good imo.</div>
