## Sarcastic Bio

Despite being incredibly handsome and popular I was drawn to the quiet dignity of software development for a major multinational corporation. My years of experience editing the highschool poetry magazine and playing videogames gave me a solid foundation for my career in software development.

## Errata

 - I've worked in climate research groups on super computers and I've sold t-shirts. Selling t-shirts is a lot more fun.
 - I once killed a server in Reno just to watch it die.
 - I'm a huge gaming geek. Videogames (Xbox and PC mostly), boardgames (mostly euros, Taluva is my favorite), CCGs (M:TG), D&D, and World of Warcraft
 - I have many cats.
 - I am bigger than a breadbox.
