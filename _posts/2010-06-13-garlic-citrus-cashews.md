            This recipe sounds rather delicious. Ever used &#39;em in a salad? They sound ideal for counterbalancing
            cooling foods. Sizzling hot out of the oven, I could imagine eating them along with chunks of canteloupe or
            honeydew. <br /><br />-Do you put on the lemon juice after baking? Ascorbic acid and vinegar both break down
            at high temperatures.<br /><br />-What kind of sesame oil do you use? The best, most flavorful stuff is the
            dark colored roasted sesame oil, but it can be tough to find outside of Asian(especially Korean) grocery
            stores.</div>
